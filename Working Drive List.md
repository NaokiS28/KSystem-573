The following is a list of known working drives for the System 573.

**Context:** The Konami 573 runs the IDE/ATA port in PIO (Progammed I/O mode) and has embedded ATAPI drivers in the BIOS shell and games. The implemenation results in a the system being picky as to which drives will work in the 573. Also, even if the drive works in the 573 BIOS shell, some games (like DDR Analogue mixes) will still fail to work due to using a different ATAPI driver. That said, any drive that works with DDR Analogue mixes **will** work with the 573 BIOS shell.

#### Notes:
\* Works to boot and goes in-game but the charts and lights are not synced to the song. For example a song's audio will finish before the last step in a chart is played. It's thought that this might be due to how the drive handles the subcode data in the red book audio tracks.
