The following is a list of known working drives for the System 573.

**Context:** The Konami 573 runs the IDE/ATA port in PIO (Progammed I/O mode) and has embedded ATAPI drivers in the BIOS shell and games. The implemenation results in a the system being picky as to which drives will work in the 573. Also, even if the drive works in the 573 BIOS shell, some games (like DDR Analogue mixes) will still fail to work due to using a different ATAPI driver. That said, any drive that works with DDR Analogue mixes **will** work with the 573 BIOS shell.
