## GN894-PWB(I)

This PCB is a light output PCB that was used in the Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) Solo series  of games. As part of the deviance from a typical DDR cabinet, DDR Solo has 4 output connectors for switching AC line loads. In the manual these are labelled as use for external lamps and in the deluxe stage models, they used mains rated lamps in the 8 side lamps.

**It should go without warning that mains AC voltage can kill. Please do not work on this PCB or be near exposed metal connections on the PCB whilst the cabinet is turned on and live.**
