This is board is the IO board used with GunMania and likely GunMania II. As the game uses real BB bullets and has an actual shooting range, this board serves as mostly a drive board, altough also appears to have a serial port (or maybe ACIO), an a DB25 connector. The board hasn't been documented fully.
