# GX896-PWB(A)A - Security Cart w/ unique serial number
This PCB is used as a security cartridge. It uses a Xicor x76F041 password eeprom as the security device. It also has a DS2401 serial ID chip so that each security cart has a unique ID.

Curiously, in Dancing Stage EuroMIX, it tells the operator to write an 8-digit security number onto the game PCB and the security cart as if it had married the (blank) cart to the motherboard, however it does not actually marry the boards at all. It's not as if it couldn't, it just doesn't seem to or atleast it doesn't lock you out if the cart is used in another board.
