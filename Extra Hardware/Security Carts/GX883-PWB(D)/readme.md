# GX896-PWB(A)A - Security Cart w/ RS232 Transceiver & Audio amp control
Sometimes known as a T-Cart cart, this PCB is used as both a security cartridge, a galvanically isolated amplifier controller board and an isolated RS232 transceiver for linking units together. It uses a Xicor x76F041 password eeprom as the security device. This board provides a galvanically isolated 5V supply to the amp control header. It's practically the same as the GX896 security cart but also includes a DS2401 serial ID chip to make every security cartridge unique.

## Games used in:
