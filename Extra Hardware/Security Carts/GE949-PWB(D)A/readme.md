# GE949-PWB(D)A - Security Cart w/ RS232 Transceiver & Audio amp control
Sometimes known as a T-Cart cart, this PCB is used as both a security cartridge, a galvanically isolated amplifier controller board and an isolated RS232 transceiver for linking units together. It uses a PIC16CE625 MCU as the security device which is often called the ZS01 security chip due to the initial bytes of the internal code at address `0x0000`. This board provides a galvanically isolated 5V supply to the amp control header. It's very similar to the GX896 security cart but also includes a DS2401 serial ID chip to make every security cartridge unique.
