# GN672-PWB(F) - Stereo Audio AMP
This PCB is simply an stereo audio amp. Todo: add specifications. Likely just dual 20w/40w amplifier.

Dance Dance Revolution/Dancing Stage uses two of these PCBs: One for the full range drivers and another for the subwoofers (this amp receives an LFO channel input).
