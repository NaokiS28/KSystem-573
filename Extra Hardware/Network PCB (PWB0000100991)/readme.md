# Konami Network PCB (e-Amusement) (PWB0000100991)

This is board is a seperate PCB from the 573 that is effectively it's own system. It uses a MIPS SoC with a PCI Ethernet 10/100 controller and a 20GB IDE drive. It connects to the 573 via the bottom PCMCIA slot. It is memory mapped only. This unit is used with the GuitarFreaks and Drummania games from 8th mix onwards (at least ones supporting e-Amuse). This would allow the 573 to use downloaded content from Konami's servers and transfer player data.

The OS is UDEOS, an RTOS which has NetNucleus technology from Toshiba.
